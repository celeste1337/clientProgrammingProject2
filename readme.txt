Hi -

My project is pretty basic. It uses
- http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/
- http://dirkgroenen.nl/SVGMagic/
- jQuery UI
and the Google Maps stuff.

I don't really have an above and beyond that's particularly impressive, but I thought the way I structured my code was pretty clean.

Thanks,
Celeste Yost
